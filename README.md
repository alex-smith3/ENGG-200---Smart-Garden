# ENGG-200---Smart-Garden

For your second engineering design project, you are required to design and build a small indoor portable garden (or herb garden).

Teams are required to design and build an indoor, portable garden. You will need to automatically monitor and adjust moisture levels of the soil and lighting conditions. 
You are designing a self-sustaining mini garden that is fully automated through the use of sensors. You need to know the best light and moisture needs of the type of plant you select. 
You will be given component kits to control the plant through a light sensor and a moisture sensor based on the needs of the plant. You will use MicroPython programming which is compatible with the Pi Picos. 
You will connect the wires and seal the electronic connections in such a way so that they do not get wet. You must also think about an enclosure for your mini garden that is robust, and intact. 
You will be given a set of supplies for the project, and you may also make use of the 3D printers in the Schulich Maker Space.

You are allowed to use supplies beyond what we provide, however, they must be “recycled”, i.e. you may not purchase anything new, but you may use materials that would otherwise be placed into the
garbage or recycling bin. Please refer to the City of Calgary guidelines on the items that go in the links for black or blue bins.
Things to consider are but not limited to: the pump operation, enclosure robustness and sturdiness, water flow/overflow management, light incorporation, waterproofing and sealing, electronics
connections and safety, watering vs. flooding, and ease of use and maintenance.
